# Challenge 1 Horiseon Code Refactor
## Description
This challenge was created to refactor the HTML and CSS code to make it more accessible, and to optimize the website for search engines.
## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
## Code changes
- edited title tag in HTML to describe Horiseon website
- added semantic HTML tags (e.g. header, section, article, footer)
- added comments to both HTML and CSS
- added alt text to images
- re-organized and consolidated div tags in CSS
